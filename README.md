[00:11.22] My dad says he hates you
[00:14.27] I always forgive you
[00:16.81] For making everything so hard
[00:21.16] Yeah
[00:22.25] Like my twenty-fourth birthday
[00:25.15] You made me cry all the way home
[00:28.08] I think that's when we started falling apart
[00:50.08] 
[00:32.97] Convinced myself I could make this right
[00:35.65] But it turns out you're just a waste of time
[00:38.68] Roll your eyes and I realize
[00:52.68] 
[00:42.77] I don't even like you anymore (no, no, no)
[00:45.48] I don't know what the fuck I'm crying for (no, no, no)
[00:48.34] Can't remember what I felt before the things you put me through
[00:52.23] I know that I don't love you
[00:53.79] 'Cause I don't even like you anymore
[01:11.79] 
[00:59.26] I don't even like you anymore
[01:13.76] 
[01:06.63] I'll stay friends with your sister
[01:09.37] God knows that I'll miss her
[01:12.13] But I'll never talk to you again
[01:15.57] No, no, no
[01:17.60] Hope you find somebody
[01:20.38] Who treats you like you treated me
[01:23.13] So you can see why I don't wish you the best
[01:45.13] 
[01:28.37] Convinced myself I could make this right
[01:30.77] But it turns out you're just a waste of time
[01:33.81] Roll your eyes and I realize
[01:47.81] 
[01:38.10] I don't even like you anymore (no, no, no)
[01:40.54] I don't know what the fuck I'm crying for (no, no, no)
[01:43.42] Can't remember what I felt before the things you put me through
[01:47.48] I know that I don't love you
[01:48.92] 'Cause I don't even like you anymore
[02:06.92] 
[01:54.53] I don't even like you anymore
[02:09.03] 
[02:01.64] Don't wanna talk about it (no, no, no, no)
[02:04.33] Don't wanna hear about it (no, no, no, no)
[02:07.09] Don't wanna talk about it, mmm (no, no, no, no)
[02:30.59] 
[02:10.10] I don't even like you anymore (no, no, no)
[02:13.80] I don't know what the fuck I'm crying for (no, no, no)
[02:16.56] Can't remember what I felt before the things you put me through
[02:20.66] I know that I don't love you
[02:22.04] 'Cause I don't even like you anymore
[02:40.04] 
[02:27.55] I don't even like you anymore
[02:33.75] I don't even like you
[02:38.73] I don't even like you anymore
[02:40.18] I don't even like you anymore
[02:54.68] 
[02:44.09] I know that I don't love you
[02:47.50] Oh, no, no, no
[02:49.55] 'Cause I don't even like you, like you anymore
[02:55.11] I don't even like you anymore
